## Easy to use mips pre-processor that allows you to use £ instead of $.

Just copy in the <code>mips-pounded</code> file in your lab and replace your Makefile. You may want to edit the Makefile to point to the right file. 

Convention by the £-rebellion is to use file extension .£ for your pounded file! 

Upcoming features: 
  - Aggressive error messages if $ is detected!

## Wait, you've gotten this far and don't know the purpose of the £-rebellion? 
Don't you just hate it that mips use $ for registers. Like why?? What's so special about $? When you try typing a $ there is a 35% chance of missing the button and writing a £ instead and then you get a lot of hate messages from your assembler saying £ is an illegal character. Well we say that's racist! Studies show that if using £ instead you are 46% less likely to hit the wrong key. Also: £ just looks overall much better. So why wait? Join the rebellion now and we shall rise to become the standard!

Viva la r£volution!!!
